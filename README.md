Programs I wrote for tutorial 5 of my Introduction to Computer Science I course

The image inverse program takes a sample image and draws its inverse in a SimpleGraphics window (see note at end of readme).

The image channels program takes a sample image and draws monochromatic representations of the original image on a SimpleGraphics window (see note at end of readme).

The number triangles program prints a number triangle, according to specifications provided by the user.

NOTE: The SimpleGraphics program was not written by me, it is simply a library that was used in my tutorial.
